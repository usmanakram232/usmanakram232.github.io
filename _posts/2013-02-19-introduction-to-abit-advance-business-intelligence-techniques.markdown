##What is Business Intelligence?
Business Intelligence, is collection of techniques whch help businesses to perform informed decisions. BI Techniques usually deals with reporting and analytics.
In our course, we will consider techniques to deal with recent challenges in data analysis for business decisions.

In old times (before storage got way cheaper), most of the business data was held or hosted by structured data models like CRM and ERP's. These particular services are usually provided by big IT companies like, IBM, Oracle, and Salesforce. 
Now, as data storage is getting cheaper and its getting easier to keep all the data. Thus, very large amount of data is being generated worldwide, and is related to like everything, consumer reviews, experiences, blogs, tweets, and comments, among others. So, collecting data is also easy which is making huge piles of data, which is hard to process than storing.

Cost for storing data is usually linear O(N) but the cost for processing is nonlinear, something like O(N^2). Except, if data can be split in independed subsets to be analyzed separatly. This problem is referred to as Big Data Analysis. 

We will be dealing with following topics:

- Social Network Analysis
